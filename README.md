# ‚òÅÔ∏è Elite Tech Intern - Cloud Internship

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the **Elite Tech Intern** program. As an intern in this cloud-focused internship, I worked on real-world projects that involved cloud storage, monitoring, architecture, and security using **AWS** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.

## üìå Internship Overview

This internship helped me develop hands-on experience with:
- Cloud storage systems
- Cloud-based application monitoring
- Multi-cloud architecture design
- Cloud security policies and encryption

All tasks were performed using industry-standard platforms like **AWS**, **GCP**, and associated tools like **CloudWatch**, **IAM**, and **Cloud Monitoring**.
